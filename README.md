## Rosette API
The Rosette Text Analytics Platform uses natural language processing, statistical modeling, and machine learning to
analyze unstructured and semi-structured text across 364 language-encoding-script combinations, revealing valuable
information and actionable data. Rosette provides endpoints for extracting entities and relationships, translating and
comparing the similarity of names, categorizing and adding linguistic tags to text and more.

## Rosette API Access
